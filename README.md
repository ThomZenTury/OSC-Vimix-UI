# OSC-Vimix-UI
User Interface meant to be used with Bruno Herbelin's wonderful <a href="https://github.com/brunoherbelin/vimix">Vimix: Live Video Mixer</a>.
Built with the equally great <a href="https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/">Open Stage Control - Libre and modular OSC / MIDI controller</a>.
For more information and Video tutorials on both these applications please have a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEky5KQSvdTiofKvdcbXkwmPlWi-lTPpT">youtube playlist</a>. Part 11 is about this template.

PLEASE BE AWARE that this template is still WIP.
Known failures at the moment:
- connecting clients from different devices does not automatically load the client.json. Either load the file manually on your device cia the O-S-C toolbar or wait a few dayys until this is fixed
- snycing is messed up when connecting to clients -> same reason as above
